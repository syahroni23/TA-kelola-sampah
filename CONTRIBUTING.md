<p>I really appreciate contributions, issues and feature requests because this application is far from perfect. Feel free to Pull Request and make changes to this project.</p>
<p>Since it's not an open source project, I solved it myself. There may be many features or things that can be improved or added. So I really appreciate your help in the future as a team member.</p>

#### Notes To Contribute

Make sure to not commit generated files from your dist folder. All changes need to be made in the source files located in the `src` folder.

* Change the `scss` files to adapt styles
* Change the nunjucks based `html` files or the content defining `json` files to adapt layout and content
* Change the `js` files to adapt the application code

Always run a build and test the results before committing.
